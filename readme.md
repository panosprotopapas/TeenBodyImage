A project written in Stata in 2012 in collaboration with two other students of the University of Lausanne.

I was personally in charge of the Stata code and preparing the presentation.  The econometric analysis was a team effort.

The project studies the effect that the network of teenagers has on their body image (e.g., if they believe they are overweight when in fact they are not or the opposite).
